      "where I live in Switzerland as long as your not affected, almost no one cares about local national politics (like in a similar case with your bil - 11)<br>I&#39;d say the reason is cause people live good and only if something &quot;dramatic happens&quot; people care. in case of america something &quot;dramatic&quot; seems to happen every day, as you mentioned with abortion etc. So people are interested in that in a way that they&#39;re happy for not living there.<br>expect when covid came and we had to vote if we are ok with the goverment&#39;s covid policy (yes we voted on that, even twice and in twoweeks it will be the third time we vote on covid)<br>during that time it was crazy. Everyone was talking politics, so many qanon conspiracy people got born in that time (they existed before but during covid it seemed to explode). it even lead to really heated discussions and in the end we had one of the highest voter turnouts since a long time like 65 %, which for our standards is a lot, normaly it&#39;s around 40 % (and we vote on basically everything)<br><br>even thought i hated that time, cause i couldn&#39;t stand the discussions, i loved that people where participating in politics etc. and i find it sad that people can&#39;t show the same enthusiasm for other political discussions that are, i gues &quot;boring&quot;: retirement fond etc. (which i think is super important).<br>cause right after the covid election the voter turnout dropped to the same lvl as before. i also feel like our newespapers (specially online) are very US concentrated cause it&#39;s as you say : entertainment and entertainment sells.<br>anyway just wanted to share my thoughts\n",
      "Worst traits: Patriotic Ego Olympics masquerading as progressive advocacy and using real suffering as entertainment and jabs.<br><br>Reddit threads (already a disease without politics) like r/uk and r/europe regularly advocate for “left wing” ideas by claiming that they’re the most progressive countries in far right colonial ways. “Britain ended slavery” is r/uk’s favorite response to any accusations of racism. And r/europe will engage in imperialism apologia while claiming to be least racist region because “look at that muslim that got run over in Canada” (exact quote in a thread and yes, they meant the entire family that was unfortunately m*rdured. Accuracy doesn’t matter if you’re bad faith from the start and don’t actually care about muslims in North America.) Coming from a country that is still dealing with colonialism, the “least bad” awards are void of empathy at best and sociopathic nationalist thinking they’re leftist at worst.<br><br>And online left wing politics is all about niche ideologies that laymen cannot understand without learning about every political term and historical context of said term. Using “proletariat” instead of “working class” is ironically very alienating to the working class lol. Followed by “explaining why every other niche ideology isn’t actually left wing because they have different stances to my niche stance”\n",

      "I think that while advocacy is important, I would not wholly discount any expressing or opinions as merely being some virtue-signaling game or akin to watching sportscenter. Sure if it’s just polandball emojis and ideological catechisms, there’s usually not much worth to that. But there are often live issues that don’t necessarily map cleanly in terms of ideology, and even if they do, having to explain how and to engage with people who agree or disagree helps to clarify your own thinking. Even if you end up in a debate with someone, where the two of you are pretty much entrenched and aren’t able to convince one another, it may be helpful in terms of informing others. <br>The thing is, disagreement on the internet is exhausting, and a lot of the time the issue boils down to first principles or basic decency, at which point you’re not going to get much of anywhere or anything, at the cost of your sanity and mental health. The challenge at the end is staying informed and engaged—which, I think, is a prerequisite to becoming so invested in an issue that you get involved in issue advocacy or party politics—while avoiding moronic/hurtful/useless interactions and maintaining a bit of perspective, so it doesn’t ‘get to you’.<br>Personally I’ve almost stopped almost any such discussion in the past year or so, and while I think that’s been a load off, you lose something by that lack of engagement, too.\n",

      "UgxbSkcDAL02Wr2Kp2N4AaABAg I was also scared by this story in a way, and couldn&#39;t help but see similarities between myself and Jack. I also enjoy Project Zomboid, one of the games the group played I believe. But more seriously, myself and some of my friends inhabited some very similar unsupervised, and crankish, online spaces when I was a teenager that was full of much the same crap that Jack&#39;s online world was full of. One of these groups that a friend of mine was in even showed up in an Israeli newspaper about the rise of antisemitism in the UK, which was the wake up call for me to get the hell out of the there. <br><br>When I think about the kinds of role models in my teenage years who impacted me the most positively, and helped steer me away from those spaces, it was the kind of people you talked about - younger teachers in their 20s and 30s. The young history teacher who started the school debate club comes to mind for me. He was the guy we went to for advice when we realised the groups we were in were not ok. But once you leave school, it&#39;s lot harder to find these role models in my experience, especially with Covid in the last few years. I do think that the impact of Covid in sending our generation permanently online for two years is not discussed enough - it led to both a lack of real world role models and more time spent online to get sucked into dangerous online echo chambers.<br><br> I&#39;m 22 now and I go to university, but I can&#39;t really think of any of those role models like my high school teachers, in my life now. University has felt very corporate and impersonal to me (Covid certainly influenced this), in a way that made it harder to make meaningful relationships with older professors and tutors, but this video has made me think that maybe I could have tried harder to foster those relationships, and should do more going forward. Maybe if I had tried harder I would feel less scared about graduating and have more of a plan lol.<br><br>Anyway, a very thought-provoking and refreshing video, its nice to see you in a sort of less scripted and more casual format from time to time. :) 2258 2023-04-17T19:58:23Z\n",

I have studied Politics, and one of the recurring themes when studying subjects such as Latin American Politics or US foreign policy is the consequences of the US putting itself in the position of a Global sort of police. Discussing the US notion of greatness is a mostly different topic, although it is worth noting in this context that you are the best at barely anything except for GDP and military spending. You most certainly are not qualified to effectively or rather positively influence the politics of other nations, as history has proven on so many occasions that it feels like beating a dead horse at this point. Yet somehow, you feel victimised when someone makes you look bad because of something you very much did do. Let me put it like this, if someone you knew stole from you or in any other way betrayed or wronged you and someone else informed you about it and that person, in turn, was chastised for &quot;being a snitch&quot;, how would you feel not only about that criticism but the people who made that criticism? My guess would be that not only would you view the people making that criticism as fundamentally untrustworthy but, in turn, traitorous. <br>The US&#39;s self-perception is only functional so long as it withholds itself from the application of almost any of the standards it holds others to. 0 2023-05-19T19:38:34Z\n",
