      "where I live in Switzerland as long as your not affected, almost no one cares about local national politics (like in a similar case with your bil - 11)<br>I&#39;d say the reason is cause people live good and only if something &quot;dramatic happens&quot; people care. in case of america something &quot;dramatic&quot; seems to happen every day, as you mentioned with abortion etc. So people are interested in that in a way that they&#39;re happy for not living there.<br>expect when covid came and we had to vote if we are ok with the goverment&#39;s covid policy (yes we voted on that, even twice and in twoweeks it will be the third time we vote on covid)<br>during that time it was crazy. Everyone was talking politics, so many qanon conspiracy people got born in that time (they existed before but during covid it seemed to explode). it even lead to really heated discussions and in the end we had one of the highest voter turnouts since a long time like 65 %, which for our standards is a lot, normaly it&#39;s around 40 % (and we vote on basically everything)<br><br>even thought i hated that time, cause i couldn&#39;t stand the discussions, i loved that people where participating in politics etc. and i find it sad that people can&#39;t show the same enthusiasm for other political discussions that are, i gues &quot;boring&quot;: retirement fond etc. (which i think is super important).<br>cause right after the covid election the voter turnout dropped to the same lvl as before. i also feel like our newespapers (specially online) are very US concentrated cause it&#39;s as you say : entertainment and entertainment sells.<br>anyway just wanted to share my thoughts\n",
      "Worst traits: Patriotic Ego Olympics masquerading as progressive advocacy and using real suffering as entertainment and jabs.<br><br>Reddit threads (already a disease without politics) like r/uk and r/europe regularly advocate for “left wing” ideas by claiming that they’re the most progressive countries in far right colonial ways. “Britain ended slavery” is r/uk’s favorite response to any accusations of racism. And r/europe will engage in imperialism apologia while claiming to be least racist region because “look at that muslim that got run over in Canada” (exact quote in a thread and yes, they meant the entire family that was unfortunately m*rdured. Accuracy doesn’t matter if you’re bad faith from the start and don’t actually care about muslims in North America.) Coming from a country that is still dealing with colonialism, the “least bad” awards are void of empathy at best and sociopathic nationalist thinking they’re leftist at worst.<br><br>And online left wing politics is all about niche ideologies that laymen cannot understand without learning about every political term and historical context of said term. Using “proletariat” instead of “working class” is ironically very alienating to the working class lol. Followed by “explaining why every other niche ideology isn’t actually left wing because they have different stances to my niche stance”\n",

      "I think that while advocacy is important, I would not wholly discount any expressing or opinions as merely being some virtue-signaling game or akin to watching sportscenter. Sure if it’s just polandball emojis and ideological catechisms, there’s usually not much worth to that. But there are often live issues that don’t necessarily map cleanly in terms of ideology, and even if they do, having to explain how and to engage with people who agree or disagree helps to clarify your own thinking. Even if you end up in a debate with someone, where the two of you are pretty much entrenched and aren’t able to convince one another, it may be helpful in terms of informing others. <br>The thing is, disagreement on the internet is exhausting, and a lot of the time the issue boils down to first principles or basic decency, at which point you’re not going to get much of anywhere or anything, at the cost of your sanity and mental health. The challenge at the end is staying informed and engaged—which, I think, is a prerequisite to becoming so invested in an issue that you get involved in issue advocacy or party politics—while avoiding moronic/hurtful/useless interactions and maintaining a bit of perspective, so it doesn’t ‘get to you’.<br>Personally I’ve almost stopped almost any such discussion in the past year or so, and while I think that’s been a load off, you lose something by that lack of engagement, too.\n",

      "My biggest pet peeve is the rise of smug, Self righteous video essayists and twitch streamers who pedal niche or very one sided interpretations of politics and esoteric theory to an impressionable audience, and the.n Watching as said audience repeats their same arguments and words verbatim, Or instead just f discussing a topic with you, They’ll send you a clip or video from some smug political video essayist.<br><br>It’s outsourcing your capability to form original political arguments to someone who conflates entertainment value with political merit. <br><br>I want to gouge my eyes out every time someone asks if I watched Hbomberguy\n"
